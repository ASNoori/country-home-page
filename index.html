          Þingvellir (Thingvellir) is a historic site and national park in
          Iceland, east of Reykjavík. It's known for the Alþing (Althing), the
          site of Iceland's parliament from the 10th to 18th centuries. On the
          site are the Þingvellir Church and the ruins of old stone shelters.
          The park sits in a rift valley caused by the separation of 2 tectonic
          plates, with rocky cliffs and fissures like the huge Almannagjá fault.

        <p>
          Landmannalaugar is a location in Iceland's Fjallabak Nature Reserve in
          the Highlands. It is on the edge of the Laugahraun lava field. This
          lava field was formed by an eruption in approximately 1477. It is
          largely known for its natural geothermal hot springs and surrounding
          landscape.

        <p>
          Mývatn is a volcanic lake in northern Iceland. On the northeastern
          shore, Reykjahlíð village has an information center and is a base for
          exploring the area. East of here, Mývatn Nature Baths have a naturally
          heated man-made lagoon, with mineral-rich waters known for their
          health-giving properties. A short distance away, near Námafjall
          Mountain, is Hverir, a hot-springs area with boiling mud pots and
          fumaroles.
